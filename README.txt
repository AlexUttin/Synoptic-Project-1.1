Tourism Assistance is software that was made in a way that can be adapted easily and added to.
There are 7 classes in this software.
AirTravel.java is an object which stores Air Travel information.
Surrounding.java is an object which stores information on the surrounding areas.
Accommodation.java is an object which stores information on Accommodation in an around the areas you have chosen.
Attractions.java is an object which stores information on this to do in the area like restaurants and beaches etc.
Main.java is where the program is run, this is where the TourismAssistance object is created.
TourismAssistance is where the bulk of everything is done. In there is all the arraylists which are composed of objects which store
the information.
TourismAssistance is also where the travel planner is located.

The software is adaptable as the TourismAssistance object is not built around Lobitos alone but is generalised and so
any location can be used. The key to this is the txt files that accompany the software.
Located in each of the txt files is information relating to the title of that file, this information can easily be replaced for
a different city or location. These txt files can then still be used and the location can be changed from Lobitos.

The information for event planner is displayed once the program has ran through.
